## Play Drums Application
- Drumkit is a simple, intuitive, easy to use drumming application, 
that aims to facilitate the exercise of rithmic abilties for the music enthusiasts regrdless of their age! 

## Features
- The Drumkit has a minimalist design with a couple of features that makes it fun to use and explore different percussive sounds. 
- Besides the minimalist and easy to use interface the colors and the font used for this application were chosen to suggest a playful and inspiring environment.
- At the top the application title is placed with a hammer that represents the percusive nature of this application.
- Below the title, the user can find a dropdown menu to select one of the four drum kits, and under this menu the drum pads are placed as the main interactive area. 
- The drum pads have a suggestive background image of a drum kit. 

### Build Features
- The header element placed on top, representing the name of the application "Drumkit" is interactive in nature and will change color when hovered over. 
- Immediately below the title a dropdown menu is placed for the user to change the drumkit sounds for all the drum pads / buttons.
- The drum pads are placed under the kit select area over the main interactive section.  

- __Kit select__
- The "kit select" menu features a total of four drum kits, each containing 5 sounds in total:
  - kick, snare, perc (percussion), hihat and crash (cymbal).
- This dropdown menu is interactive in nature and the text will change color when hovered over.
- The sounds presented in each kit are different in style and offer an inspiring range of percussive elements of the same kind (kick, snare, perc, hihat & crash).

- __Drum pads__
- The last and most important interactive part is the drum pads/ buttons area where the user can interact with each assigned button in order to play the percussive elements.
- Each button was designed to be reactive and will change the font color and the size when hovered over or when played, or clicked on.
- Also each button features a different minimalist circle symbol that was selected per sound which is meant to represent that specific instrument.
- This area has a inspiring and suggestive background that respresents a black and white photography of an acousitc drum kit. 
- The photo background suggests the higher importance of this area as being the "playground" or the main interactive part.

### Followup Features
- Should this application receive a positive feedback from the music enthusiasts, a few followup features would include:
  - Integration of another 7 drum pads and the structuring of the drum pads as a full piano octave that presents 7 white keys and 5 black keys.
    - this feature would facilitate then a further on matching of the plugin with the MIDI protocol and the ability to play each drum pad as from a midi keyboard.
  - Addition of more than ten drum kits in order to have a rich variation of sounds
  - An extra importrarnt feature that would allow the user to also change sounds per drum pad enabling combinations of sounds from all drum kits. This feature would ofcourse respect the drum pad/ button type allowing only a sellection of the same type of percussive instrument => kick - kick1, kick2, kick3 etc.
  - Another extra feature would enable the user to save personal drum kit combinations, with the preffered souns sellected for each drum pad.
